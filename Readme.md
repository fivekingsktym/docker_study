# Docker Basic Commands

```bash
docker images # showing all previous installed images

# Showing running commands
docker ps #showing current running containers
docker ps -a #showing all current and previous runned containers

<or> # both are same ["container ls" is the modern command, old "ps" is also working a command]

docker container ls #showing current running containers
docker container ls -a #showing all current and previous runned containers


# running a docker image ------------------
# running in attach mode
docker run <image_name:version>
# running in detach mode
docker run -d <image_name:version>

<or>
# run a container using their id
docker start <container_id>
# running a docker image ------------------


# map and run a host port to running container port
docker run -d -p <host:container_port> <image_name:version>
# example
docker run -d -p 5000:6379 redis
docker run -d -p 6000:6379 redis:5.0

# running a docker container with a dedicated name
docker run -d -p <host:container_port> --name <custom_container_name> <image_name:version>
# example
docker run -d -p 6000:6379 --name redis_fivekings redis


# login to running docker container (like:- accessing to a remote system(os))
docker execute -iterative_terminal shell_path
# example
docker exec -it redis_abhi /bin/bash
# exiting from loggined container or remote system
"ctrl+d" or type "exit"

# stoping a running container
docker stop <container_id>

# printing docker running logs
docker logs <container_id>


# running a custom docker file
docker build -t(flag_to_tag_the_image_name) <image_name> <path_of_dockerfiel>
# example
docker build -t getting-started .
